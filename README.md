Exact Audio Copy Folder Creation
A Python script companion to Exact Audio Copy to ease folder creation.

New folder is formatted as 
[Artist] - [Album] ([Year]) {[Catalogue Number]} [FLAC]

EAC launches (as administrator) after folder creation.

Shortcut of Exact Audio Copy required in the same directory if using .bat file

Launch 'New CD Rip Start.bat' to start and launch Exact Audio Copy afterwards.

Launch 'NewCD.py' to start without Exact Audio Copy launching. Might not work?
